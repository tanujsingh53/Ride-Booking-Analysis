# 🚖 Power BI Project – Ride Booking Analysis (NCR Region)

Completed an end-to-end analytics project analyzing ride booking behavior across the NCR region using Power BI, Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing.

The dashboard highlights:
✔ Successful Ride %
✔ Customer vs Driver Cancellation Rate
✔ Incomplete Rides Rate
✔ Top 5 Cancellation Locations
✔ Hourly & Monthly Booking Patterns
✔ Revenue & Profit Estimation

Data was cleaned and prepared using Python (NumPy & Pandas), and all visual insights were modeled in Power BI using calculated columns and DAX measures.

This project helps identify cancellation behavior, understand peak-time issues, and improve operational decision-making.
