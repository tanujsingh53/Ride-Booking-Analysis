# 🚖 Power BI Project – Ride Booking Analysis (NCR Region)

Completed an end-to-end analytics project analysing ride booking behaviour across the NCR region using Power BI, Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing.

The dashboard highlights:

✔ Successful Ride %

✔ Customer vs Driver Cancellation Rate

✔ Incomplete Rides Rate

✔ Top 5 Cancellation Locations

✔ Hourly & Monthly Booking Patterns

✔ Revenue & Profit Estimation

Data was cleaned and prepared using Python (NumPy & Pandas), and all visual insights were modeled in Power BI using calculated columns and DAX measures.

This project helps identify cancellation behaviour, understand peak-time issues, and improve operational decision-making.
